# ForceACallout
Force A Callout is an LSPDFR plugin that lets players start a random callout by pressing a key.
The player can also change his availability by pressing a key.
All of the settings, including keybindings are changeable in an .ini file.

You are allowed to use some of the code in your own projects, I only ask for some credits for it.
